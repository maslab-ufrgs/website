<p align="left">ATUCG (Agent--based environmenT for aUtomatiC annotation of
     Genomes) is an agent--based environment to automate most of the tedious 
work      envolved in the genome annotation. </p>
     
<p align="left">Most of the automated methods are allocate to agents distributed 
     in the different layers of the architecture. </p>

<p align="left"><b>Layer I</b> deals with the genome sequencing activities. 
     Having received a file containing the DNA sequencing of a given organism, 
     layer I is aimed at helping the user to define the Open Reading Frames 
(ORFs).      To this means, specific programs are used, each regarding the 
expertise of      a particular agent. The output that layer I passes to layer 
II is a file containing      a list of non--redundant ORFs.<br>

<p align="left"><b>Layer II</b> is perhaps the most interesting from the point
     of view of both research and operational aspects, being also the most
complex      to design and implement. The aim here is threefold: design of
agents which      are experts on data extraction (e.g. from Swiss-prot and
TrEMBL) and reformatting;      building of a database of rules for annotation 
(this involves training and      validation stages using standard techniques 
from Machine Learning); automatization      of the annotation of fields related 
to motifs or profiles regarding families      of proteins (i.e. automating 
the annotation regarding Prosite and Interpro      attributes). The main output
passed to layer III is a set of proposed annotation      for selected attributes.<br>

 Layer III</b> helps the user perform the verification of      the proposed 
annotation mainly by ``translating'' the rules for annotation      into a 
semantically richer language and presenting it in a more understandable 
    form. This is done by linking attributes presented in the rules to more 
complete      data extracted from databases such as Prosite and Interpro.<br>
