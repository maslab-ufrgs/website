      <div align="left"> 
        <p>Nowadays, no genome project can escape the speed imposed by the necessity 
          of finishing the sequencing and annotation of the target organism in 
          the shortest time possible. We believe that there is a clear necessity for automatic 
          tools to help specialists to focus on activities that really require 
          their knowledge. However, very few tools exist today to automatize tasks involved 
          in such sequencing and annotation jobs. In particular, integrated tools are 
          rare. </p>
        <p>The aim of this project is to implement an ambient for automatic annotation of genomes.
           This ambient is called ATUCG - An Agent-Based Enviroment for Automatic Annotation of Genomes.
           ATUCG is integrated with others systems that focus in the development of tools for data analyze
           using agents technology.</p>
