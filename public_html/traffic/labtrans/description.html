<div class="texto">
    <br><div class="paragraph">Transportation systems are inherently complex, such that new politics and measures should be tested beforehand in laboratory before being implemented in real scenarios. Governments and companies have the necessity to simulate politics and actions they intend to implement in real world. As examples, we may mention the test of: 
    <ul>
    	<li>technological innovations' politics in the state aiming the 2014 World Cup</li>
        <li>solutions for an efficient movimentation and transportation of citizens</li>
        <li>politics and actions for emergencies managing and security</li> 
        <li>solutions for users of transportation system services, either public or not: </li>
        <ul>
        	<li id="subitem">broadcast of information</li>
            <li id="subitem">recommendation of routes or public transportation</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    </div>
<div class="paragraph">Considering the presented issues, this project aims to develop tools destined for simulation and test of politics and actions related to urban transportation and mobility, such as dissemination of information to transportation system users. However, in order to provide helpful information in the required time, it is necessary a tool able to deal with questions such as routing and dynamic allocation.</div>
