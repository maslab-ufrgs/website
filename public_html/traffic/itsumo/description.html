	ITSUMO project includes the development of a traffic simulator. One of the aims
of the project is to create an information system for urban mobility capable of
integrating different functionalities, such as a simple traffic control (mostly based
on control of traffic lights), traffic management and real-time information
providing via internet and/or mobile phone. The idea is to distribute the system
under free-software license.

       The ITSUMO project uses data from several sources, which can be both off-line information 
(maintained by different providers), and on-line information (e.g. traffic flow).
The network topology data, for instance, is provided by traffic authorities. Currently,
given that there is a lack of on-line data, which is not collected in the city of Porto Alegre 
so far, we work basically with off-line data. However, the system is designed to use
real-time information. Most of the information is stored in XML files.<br><br>
	There is also a module for definition of driver's decision-making; by default, the decision-making procedures are related to the Nagel-Schreckenberg automata,
which provides a good approximation of dynamics for microscopic simulations. However, when the researcher is interested in studying the behavior of a group of drivers, or drivers with more complex decision-making rules, it is possible to specify and attach drivers with arbitrary behaviors to the simulator. This is done via the module for definition of driver's decision-making.<br><br>
	The simulator kernel retrieves the necessary information from the database, performs the computation of the vehicles
movement, updates the network state and stores this in flat files. If special drivers are
defined, then the simulator also loads such models.<br><br>
     A visualization module retrieves data originated from the microscopic simulation
and exhibits a graphical representation of the traffic simulation. The ITSUMO system
is thus composed by four distinct modules: the data module, the simulation kernel,
the driver definition module, and the visualization module. These modules are further
detailed next.

       This module manages the traffic information data that serves as the basis to the microscopic 
simulation. This information is stored in a XML file, which means that the data is represented in the form of tags. 
Since performance is a key issue in real-time simulation, a database with simple interface and quick
response is required. <br><br>
    The database structure reflects the way the simulation occurs. Thus, the data module
is in charge of providing the necessary means to specify several topology details and
network constrains. The entities that define the network are ilustrated below, and they
also describe the relationship between the several traffic network
components. For instance, each lane is associated with exactly one laneset, and each
section is composed by exactly two nodes. The data module was designed in a way to
ease the task of specifying the traffic network topology.

       This module was developed using a C++ platform and is responsible for
simulating the traffic flow in a given traffic network. <br><br>
    The current version of the simulator solves the issue related to the difficulty to represent urban scenarios.
Thus, the simulation tool we developed supports different kinds of elements, such as
lanes, lanesets, streets, sections, vehicles, sources and sinks (of vehicles), sensors and
detectors, traffic lights, etc.<br><br> 
    The simulation occurs in discrete steps and is implemented as a series of updates
in the drivers' decisions of movement, followed by simultaneous updates in the vehicles' positions in the network and finally updates in the status of objects such as nodes,
sources, sinks and traffic lights. Each update in a node or traffic light may modify its current behavior depending on its internal state and on the current traffic flow. Sources and
sinks are also activated whenever a vehicle passes over a crossing. This is the moment
in the simulation when vehicles might be inserted or removed from the network. Note
that special drivers (such as floating cars) are not removed from the simulation. Also,
they do follow specific routes, in opposition to standard drivers which move through the
network in a non-deterministic way. The last action to be performed in each iteration is
to fire the sensors and detectors, updating their internal status and eventually displaying
partial simulation results.<br><br>
    The simulation results can be formatted according to the user needs. The most usual
formats are the 'cell map' and the 'laneset occupation map'. The former is a representation 
of a set of cells associated with each lane in the network. This set of cells indicates
which portions of the lane are occupied by which vehicle, providing the most detailed
output possible. On the other hand, the 'laneset occupation map' is a high-level output
which specifies the rate of occupation (density) for each laneset in the network. This
output is generally more useful since it hides the individual status of the vehicles and
focus on the overall stochastic behavior of the simulation.

       Modeling a driver can be approached in different ways, depending on the purpose of the
simulation. In most cases, the objective is to simulate the collective or macroscopic behavior. 
However, this behavior emerges out of individual ones. Simple algorithms, like
the Nagel-Schreckenberg model, can be used to describe vehicles movement without
loosing significant simulation fidelity with reality.<br><br>
     A driver model can be splitted into two different components: decision about movement and planning. 
These two parts together can guide a vehicle in the network. The
movement decision is responsible for a vehicles short-time movement. On the other
hand, the planning decision is related to a more sophisticated decision-making, e.g.
which direction to turn and what to do in case a jam exists.<br><br>
     The movement decision-making is in charge of local optimization, i. e., to decide
whether it is better to take-over the headway vehicle, to change lane and to avoid collisions 
with other vehicles. More complex than the former, the planning decision-making
component is in charge of deciding which path to follow from one point to other in the
traffic network. To make such decisions it is necessary to observe the traffic forecast
(if available), the path restrictions, etc. Moreover, it is necessary to implement some
kind of learning skills in the driver module so that it improves future decisions. Most
of the optimization performed intends to reduce the amount of time to travel from an
origin to a destination. The planning component can use several heuristics and methods
to perform those tasks.

      This is the module that allows the graphical visualization of the simulation results. The
visualization can be either in a macroscopic or microscopic level. At a macroscopic
level, the visualization considers only data which reflect the overall behavior of the
network, abstracting details and providing an useful tool to capture the big picture of
what is happening in a specific scenario. <br><br>
    On the other hand, the microscopic level visualization provides an interface through
which one can see, both in 2D and 3D manner, individual vehicles movement. In order
to obtain a more realistic and detailed visualization, this module is being developed
using the OpenGL graphic library, enabling features such as walk-through navigation
and detail-focused interfaces.<br><br> 
    The visualization of data at microscopic level is the kernel of the information system
for the traffic engineer and/or the urban planning experts. At this level, the whole system
can be used to perform simulations in order to check what happens if a shopping mall
is built in a specific place, or a new arterial is added to the network (as it was the case
recently in Porto Alegre), or traffic lights are synchronized in a given way. In the next
section we discuss a scenario from Porto Alegre in which the ITSUMO system was
used: a simulation of an arterial with different rates of vehicles insertion in given nodes
of the network.<br><br>
