<div align="justify">The aim of the project is twofold. First, to
tackle a complex problem like traffic by means of a multi-disciplinary
approach. Second,to break with the current dependence induced by the
use of black box traffic simulation systems. </div>
<p align="justify">Hence, a microscopic simulator will be developed,
whose model is based on Celullar Automata and on Nagel-Schreckenberg
automata rules, also allowing a model on individual vehicle level. A
novel feature here is the modelling of the driver based on artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques that permit to consider drivers like
intelligent agents, in contrast to the current models that are pure
reactive and ignore the mental state (informational and motivational)
from the drivers. </p>
<p align="justify">The simulator is programmed on an object-oriented
paradigm with several classes such as drivers, vehicles, traffic
lights, lanes, and so on. Also a database and a visualization module
are planned. The expected results are the implementation of a basic
framework in which the several groups (physics, traffic engineers and
computer science and art. intelligence) can run and test their own
scenarios. </p>
