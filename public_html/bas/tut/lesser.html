<b>Coordination Techniques for Cooperative Agents</b><br>
This lecture will cover the major approaches for implementing
cooperative agent coordination. It will discuss such distinctions as
bottom-up v s top-down, results sharing vs. task sharing, logic based
approaches vs. quantitative approaches, reactive vs planning
approaches, group coordination vs. society coordination. It will
present in detail coordination frameworks such as the Contract-Net,
Partial Global Planning (PGP and GPGP), GRATE, STEAM and DEC MDPs.

Victor R. Lesser received his B.A. in Mathematics from Cornell
University in 1966, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer
Science in the area of computer architecture from Stanford University
in 1969 and 1972, respectively. He has been a professor in the
Computer Science Department of the University of Massachusetts on the
Amherst campus since 1977 and in 1992 became the director of the
Multi-Agent Systems Laboratory. Professor Lesser was General Chairman
of the First International Conference on Multi-Agent Systems (ICMAS)
held in 1995, the founding president of International Foundation for
Multi-Agent Systems (IFMAS), and a founding fellow of the American
Association of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). His major research
focus is on the control and organization of complex AI systems.  He
has been working in the field of Multi-Agent Systems and Distributed
Sensor Networks for close to 30 years.  Prior to coming to the
University of Massachusetts, he was a research scientist at Carnegie-
Mellon University where he was the systems architect for the Hearsay-
II speech understanding system, which was the first blackboard system
developed.  In addition to this work, he has also done research in
computer architecture, parallel and distributed processing,
information gathering, sound understanding, intelligent user
interfaces and real-time agent architectures. His work is widely
cited and includes over 500 publications.
