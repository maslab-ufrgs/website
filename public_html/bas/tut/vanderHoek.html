<b>Course: Logics for Multi-Agent Systems</b><br>
We first see why modal logics have been so successful to model various attitudes of agents (informational, motivational or social), and see the main concepts of the most famous BDI logic for Beliefs, Desires and Intentions. Then, zooming in on a specific modal logic, i.e. the logic of knowledge, we see how one easily obtains group notions of knowledge from the basic ones. We use the modal semantics to model some non-trivial MAS-scenario’s in which knowledge plays a crucial role.

<b>Course: Introduction to Game Theory</b><br>
We introduce the basic concepts in `classical´ game theory, starting with games in strategic and extensive form. We then come across some well-known solution concepts, like Nash Equilibrium and related notions like dominated strategies, Pareto optimality and backward induction. In the last part of the course we deal with some notions in social choice theory, leading to the famous Theorem of Arrow.

Wiebe van der Hoek is head of the Agent ART group in the Computer Science Department at the University of Liverpool. He is interested in formal methods for Multi-Agent Systems, especially systems in which agents have to make strategic decisions under partial information. He works on modal logics to specify and verify Multi-Agent Systems, and also logics to reason about and in games. Van der Hoek is editor-in-chief of Knowledge, Rationality and Action, leader of the Workpackage on Student Integration of AgentLink, and since 1992 co-organizer of a conference on Logics for Games and Decision Theory (LOFT).
