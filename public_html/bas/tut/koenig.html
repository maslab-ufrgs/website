<b>Lecture 1: Decision Making in Robotics under Time Pressure and Incomplete 
Information</b>
<br>
Autonomous agents must be able to make good decisions in complex situations
that involve a substantial degree of uncertainty, yet find solutions in a
timely manner despite a large number of potential contingencies. 
Unfortunately, decision making in non-deterministic domains is typically
time-consuming due to the large number of contingencies. Thus, autonomous
agents need to use decision-making techniques that speed up planning by 
sacrificing the optimality of the resulting plans, such as agent-centered
search and assumption-based planning. In this tutorial, I will give an
in-depth overview of such techniques, including algorithms, their analysis 
using a unifying graph-theoretic framework (including complexity results), and
their integration into complete agent architectures. I will then show how
these techniques can be used to solve robot-navigation problems.

I will report on results from a large number of researchers, including Craig
Tovey, Maxim Likhachev, David Furcy, Yaxin Liu, Yuri Smirnov, Anthony Stentz,
Illah Nourbakhsh, and others.

<b>Lecture 2: Multi-Robot Coordination </b><br>
In this tutorial, I will discuss two different multi-robot coordination
approaches: one that uses explicit communication and one that does not.
</p><p>
Consider the following agent-coordination task: A team of Mars rovers needs to 
visit a number of rocks to take rock samples. The assignment of rocks to
rovers can turn out to be suboptimal as the rovers gain additional information
about the terrain.  How to assign and re-assign rocks to rovers is a difficult 
problem. For example, centralized control is inefficient in terms of both the
required amount of computation and communication since the central controller
is the bottleneck of the system. Auctions, on the other hand, are efficient in 
terms of both the required amount of computation and communication since
information is compressed into numeric bids that the robots can compute in
parallel. In this tutorial, I will discuss how to set up auctions so that they 
run in real time, yet achieve good team performance, including results that
provide the provable constant factor performance guarantees of auction
mechanisms for agent coordination.
</p><p>
Robots that use auctions have to communicate explicitly with each other.  Ant 
robots, on the other hand, are simple creatures with limited sensing and
computational capabilities as well as very noisy actuation. They have the
advantage that they are easy to program and cheap to build. This makes it 
feasible to deploy groups of ant robots and take advantage of the resulting
fault tolerance and parallelism. Ant robots cannot use conventional planning
methods due to their limited sensing and computational capabilities. In this 
tutorial, I will describe navigation methods that address these limitations by
leaving markings in the terrain, similar to what real ants do. These markings
are shared among all ant robots and allow them to cover terrain even if they 
do not have any kind of memory, cannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor plan
complete paths. These navigation methods do not require the ant robots to be
localized, which completely eliminates solving difficult and time-consuming 
localization problems. They can be used by single ant robots and groups of ant
robots and are robust even if the ant robots are moved without realizing this
(say, by people running into them), some ant robots fail, and some markings 
get destroyed.

Sven Koenig is an associate professor in computer science at the University of
Southern California. He received his Ph.D . degree in computer science from
Carnegie Mellon University for his thesis on "Goal-Directed Acting with
Incomplete Information." He also holds M.S. degrees from the University of
California at Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University and is the recipient of 
an NSF CAREER award, an IBM Faculty Partnership Award, a Charles Lee Powell
Foundation Award, a Raytheon Faculty Fellowship Award, the Tong Leong Lim
Pre-Doctoral Prize from the University of California at Berkeley, and a 
Fulbright Fellowship. Several of his students won awards for their research as
well.
</p><p>
Sven is interested in intelligent systems that have to operate in large,
nondeterministic, nonstationary or only partially known domains. Most of his 
research centers around techniques for decision making (planning and learning)
that enable situated agents (such as robots or decision-support systems) to
act intelligently in their environments and exhibit goal-directed behavior in 
real-time, even if they have only incomplete knowledge of their environment,
imperfect abilities to manipulate it, limited or noisy perception or
insufficient reasoning speed. He believes that finding good solutions to these 
problems requires approaches that cut across many different fields and,
consequently, his research draws on areas such as artificial intelligence,
decision theory, and operations research. Applications of his research include 
planetary exploration, supply-chain management, medicine, crisis management
(such as oil-spill containment) and robotics.
</p><p>
Sven has edited several conference proceedings and published over 100 papers
in various areas of artificial intelligence and robotics, including 12 full 
papers at AAAI and IJCAI, as well as papers in planning (ICAPS, AIPS, ECP),
agents (AAMAS, Autonomous Agents), machine learning (ICML, COLT), numerical
artificial intelligence and control (NIPS, UAI, AI and Mathematics), knowledge 
representation and reasoning (KR), robotics (ICRA, IROS, ROBOTICS), and
others. He was conference co-chair of the 2002 Symposium on Abstraction,
Reformulation, and Approximation (SARA), conference co-chair of the 2004 
International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS), and
program co-chair of the 2005 International Joint Conference on Autonomous
Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS). He is an associate editor of the 
Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) and on the steering or
advisory committees of ICAPS, SARA, and Americas School on Agents and
Multi-Agent Systems. In 2005, he helped to start Robotics: Science and Systems 
(ROBOTICS), a highly selective robotics conference.
</p><p>
Sven is passionate about helping students and young researchers to get a good
start in their careers. On the high-school level, he repeatedly represented
the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) as a judge at
ISEF, which brings together over 1,400 high-school students from more than
forty nations. On the university level, he was three times co-chair of the 
AAAI student abstract and poster program, often participates as panelist or
mentor in doctoral consortia of artificial intelligence conferences, and
frequently presents tutorials about his research at summer schools and 
conferences. In 2005, he co-organized the first USC Programming Contest .
</p><p>
In his spare time, Sven cares for more than fifty newts from all over the
world. He is also a member of the Academy of Magical Arts at the Magic Castle 
in Hollywood, but has not yet managed to make all (or even some) of his work
disappear.
