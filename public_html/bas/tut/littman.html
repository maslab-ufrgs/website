<b>
Learning and Planning in Markov Environments<b><br>
Michael L. Littman (Rutgers University)<br>
This tutorial will survey central concepts in single- and multi-agent 
decision making for sequential problems.  The first half of the
presentation will focus on planning approaches---efficient algorithms
for computing (near) optimal behavior for a variety of different
settings.  The second half will turn to learning approaches in which 
behavioral decisions are made without an a priori model of the
environment.

Michael Littman is director of the Rutgers Laboratory for Real-Life
Reinforcement Learning (RL^3) and his research in machine learning 
examines algorithms for decision making under uncertainty.  After
earning his Ph.D. from Brown University in 1996, Michael worked as an
assistant professor at Duke University, a member of technical staff in
AT&T's AI Principles Research Department, and is now an associate 
professor of computer science at Rutgers.  He served on the executive
council of the American Association for AI, and is an advisory board
member of the Journal of AI Research and an action editor of the
Journal of Machine Learning Research.
